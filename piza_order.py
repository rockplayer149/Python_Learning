# Example Output
# Your final bill is: $28.
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happen:

# Hint
# Think about what you've learnt about multiple if statements and see if you can reduce the number of lines of code while having the same functionality.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
