# Your Life in Weeks
# Instructions
# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# Example Input
# 56
# Example Output
# You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
# e.g. When you hit run, this is what should happend

# Hint
# There are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.
# Try copying the example output into your code and replace the relevant parts so that the sentence is formated the same way.


# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
a = int(age)
years_remaining = 90 - a
month_remain =  12 * years_remaining
days_remain = 365 * years_remaining
week_remain = 56 * years_remaining

print(f"you have {month_remain} month remaining , you have {days_remain} days remaining, you have {week_remain} week remaining")
